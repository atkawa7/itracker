		<section name="About itracker">
			<p>
				itracker is a true open source issue tracking system
				licensed under the LGPL license.
            </p>
			<p>
				itracker is built using Java enterprise technology.
            </p>
			<p>
				itracker is a professional, easy to use, open, integrateable, fast,
				modular, customizable and scalable solution for all kind of projects.
            </p>
			<p>
				Currently there is a bunch of people rewriting itracker towards
				a new Release 3.0, but it seems to take time. The refactoring is
				based on Spring 2.0, Hibernate 3 and Struts 1.X.
				<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=54141&amp;atid=472807"></a>
				The Release 3.0 is not yet finished, and if you or your company can
				give us a hand you are more than welcome to contribute! If you are able to help
				(by programming, documenting or testing...), then please feel free
				to join.
				<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=54141&amp;atid=472807">
					<br />
					THERE ARE STILL SOME (MINOR) BUGS TO GO (COME ON GUYS - OPEN SOURCE MEANS
					EVERYONE WORKS ;-&gt;)
                </a>
                - please help.	<br /> Please also help us to write further unit tests and remove scriptlets from the JSP's. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need an issue management system now, you can go and get itracker 2.4.2 on SourceForge.
                It's a reliable solution, and you'll be able to upgrade to the coming Release 3.0.
                
            </p>
                    <p>
                You can also now start to testdrive our Release 3.0 from the trunk. It's quite stable.
