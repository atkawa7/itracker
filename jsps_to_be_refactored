JSP Refactoring Notes: 
======================

Not yet refactored JSPs:

list_users.jsp
list_projects.jsp



General refactoring: 
- Move Service Calls to the Actions.
- Populate Model POJOs in the Actions, and put them into the Request / Session scope for retrieval. 
- Use PTOs if needed (don't dirty the Model POJOs just because you need them different in the GUI).
